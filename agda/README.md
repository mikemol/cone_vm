# Agda Proof Kernel (Scaffold)

This directory hosts the initial Agda module scaffolding for the semantic
kernel described in `in/in-26.md`. The intent is to capture the proof roadmap
with minimal, syntactically valid placeholders so work can begin without
blocking on full formalization.

Status: scaffold only (no proofs, no CI integration).

Suggested entrypoint: `agda/Prism/Prism.agda`.
