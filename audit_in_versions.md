# Audit: in/in-*.md + in/glossary.md

Generated by `scripts/audit_in_versions.py`. Do not edit by hand.

Methodology:
- Tokenization: `[^\W\d_][\w]*` (unicode letters, then word chars), lowercased.
- Stopwords: English common words + Python keywords (see script).
- Sets are unique tokens after filtering.
- Wedge product: intersection of adjacent token bigram sets (ordered pairs).
- Glossary: `in/glossary.md` is included as a standalone appendix.
