## 0. Purpose

This document specifies the **site** ((C,J)) whose category of sheaves constitutes the Prism semantic universe. It makes explicit the staging contexts, morphisms, and coverage conditions that justify interpreting the Arena as a presheaf topos and the Ledger as a sheaf object.

This note introduces **no new semantics**. It formalizes structure already implicit in the Arena/`q`/Ledger architecture.

## 1. The Category C (Staging Contexts)

### 1.1 Objects

An object of (C) is a **staging context**:

```
κ = (n, s, t, τ)
```

where:

* `n` — BSPᵗ cycle index,
* `s` — primary stratum index (slot0, slot1, wrap, …),
* `t` — micro-stratum / hyperstratum index,
* `τ` — optional locality tile or arena partition.

Intuition: (κ) describes *which portion of the Arena/frontier is visible* for reading and emission.

### 1.2 Morphisms

A morphism (f : κ' → κ) exists iff (κ) is a **coarser view** than (κ'). Concretely, any of the following may occur:

* `n' ≥ n` (later cycles forget earlier snapshots),
* `s' ≥ s` and `t' ≥ t` (later strata forget finer staging),
* `τ'` refines `τ` (locality forgets detail).

Morphisms compose transitively by forgetting. Identity morphisms are trivial forgettings. This makes (C) a small category.

---

## 2. Presheaves as Arenas

A presheaf (F : C^{op} → \mathbf{Set}) assigns:

* to each context (κ), a set of **local Arena contributions** (frontier elements),
* to each morphism (f : κ' → κ), a restriction map erasing later or finer structure.

The **Arena** is precisely the presheaf topos:

```
Arena ≅ \widehat{C} = \mathbf{Set}^{C^{op}}
```

This formalizes the statement: *the Arena is the frontier*.

## 3. The Grothendieck Topology J (Covers)

### 3.1 Covering Families

A family of morphisms ({u_i : κ_i → κ}) is a **cover** in (J) iff:

> For every candidate emission or dependency observable in context (κ), all of its semantic prerequisites are visible in at least one (κ_i).

Operationally, this means:

* all CNF-2 operands,
* all Cayley–Dickson subcomponents,
* and all required earlier strata `(s',t') < (s,t)`

are included in the covering contexts.

### 3.2 Subcanonical Property

The topology (J) is **subcanonical**:

* every representable presheaf is a sheaf.

This reflects the fact that reading a single Arena row or dependency is already canonically well-defined.

---

## 4. Sheaf Condition as Canonicalization

A presheaf (F) is a **sheaf** iff:

* for every cover ({κ_i → κ}),
* and compatible local sections (x_i ∈ F(κ_i)),
* there exists a unique glued section (x ∈ F(κ)).

Compatibility condition (Prism semantics):

```
q(x_i|_{κ_{ij}}) = q(x_j|_{κ_{ij}})
```

The gluing operation is exactly the canonicalization performed by `q` (GF(2) cancellation + interning).

Thus the associated sheaf functor:

```
a : \widehat{C} → \mathbf{Sh}(C,J)
```

is **the `q` map**.

---

## 5. Boolean Character

Because Prism semantics enforce univalence and GF(2) cancellation, the topos (\mathbf{Sh}(C,J)) is **Boolean**:

* its internal logic validates the Law of Excluded Middle,
* every subobject has a complement,
* all semantic predicates resolve to true or false after sheafification.

---

## 6. Relationship to Min(Prism)

For fixed bounds `(K,d,T)`, the restriction of (C) to those bounds yields a **finite site**.

The corresponding topos of sheaves is finitely presented, and its global semantic behavior is exhaustively enumerable (Min(Prism)).
